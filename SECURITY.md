# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue:** Do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues. Instead, report them via email to me at [kurosen930@gmail.com](mailto:kurosen930@gmail.com).

2. **Provide Details:** Include as much detail as possible in your report. Please include:
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - Any potential impacts or exploitation scenarios.

3. **Confirmation:** I will confirm the receipt of your report within 48 hours and will keep you informed about the status of your report as I investigate.

4. **Resolution:** I aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days. When the issue is resolved, I will notify you and give credit for the discovery if you would like.

## Security Updates

I release security updates as necessary. Users are strongly encouraged to keep their installations up to date to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
